# Nasa Repo

My repo for LFS which is to be used with the scratchpkg manager. This is expected to grow as time goes on but this will have to do for now.

# Versioning system so far

Galaxy releases are either on a static release cycle, or are non-github releases in which i haven't figured out what to do with yet. Still a WIP!
